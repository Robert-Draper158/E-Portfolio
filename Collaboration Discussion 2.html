							<p>GDPR governs the collection, storage and processing of data within the European Union (EU). A key purpose of this is to securing personal data, requiring organisations to ensure security measures are in place to prevent loss, destruction or damage of data and prevent unlawful or unauthorised processing (Wolford, N.D.). The act doesn’t enforce any security measures, but  it does suggest a number of standard practices, such as pseudonymization, encryption, access controls, backups and security testing (Burgess, 2020).</p>
              <p>However, the UK left the EU in 2020, and adopted it’s own GDPR law based on the EU law. There are a couple of key differences (ICO, 2023), for example, the UK has added some exemptions to GDPR in areas such as National Security, Intelligence Services and Immigration (GDPR EU, 2024). This allows the data protection principles outlined by GDPR to be ignored, however they must still comply with the UK’s Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, businesses that operate in both the UK and the EU no longer benefit from the “One Stop Shop mechanism” (IRIS FMP, N.D.). This mechanism allowed businesses to operate in multiple EU countries whilst only being required to deal with one supervisory body. Instead, businesses that transfer personal data between the UK and EU are required to deal with both supervisory bodies. The UK is also now free to reach it’s own adequacy agreements with third countries (ICO, 2023).</p>
              <p>However, although the UK is free to deviate, this is probably not in their interest as the EU is a major trading partner. Burgess (2020) describes them as the world’s strongest set of data protection rules. The EU is also a major trading partner, which makes it important for the UK’s law to align closely with the EU’s to minimise disruption.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the differences between UK and EU GDPR are minor and only apply in specific circumstances. They apply the same rigorous tests for security and it is not in the interest of the UK to deviate.</p>
