							<p>This module set out four learning outcomes that we should be able to achieve by the end of the course. These are; being able to identify challenges and opportunities in data wrangling, ability to determine the appropriate methods and tools for solving these challenges, ability to implement these solutions, and developing teamworking skills as part of a development team. In order to teach these skills we worked on a wide variety of projects, including discussions, database design, data cleaning and normalisation. Many of these projects were conducted independently for presentation in an E-portfolio. We also worked on an Individual project to design a database for a company, based upon a group project proposal.</p>
              						<p>My team’s database design proposal was for a mid-sized electronics retailer. The goal was to design a database management system that would meet their business’s needs. Although the project went well, there are a number of areas where we could have improved. At first the group was focused on an assignment for another module, meaning we did not discuss the project as early as we could have. One member took it upon themselves to start writing the report, so there was no agreed plan before they showed us their work. This is not how I have approached group work in the past. Usually I discuss the project with the members and brainstorm ideas before we organise tasks and roles in the group. In fact, Levin (2005) suggests that these sort of meetings are good practice for any group project as they help familiarise people with each other and establish strengths and roles. Fortunately everyone in the team was competent and had a clear understanding of the requirements, so we were able to mitigate this lack of preparation.</p>
              						<p>I feel that I made a fair contribution to the team project, reviewing the work and adding sections where needed. In particular I made a couple of table additions where I saw gaps in functionality and provided a more detailed description of the company’s database requirements. However, with more group planning I think that I would have been able to make a larger contribution, particularly on the critical evaluation.</p>
              						<p>This lack of planning did not impact the final project, which was an individual Executive Summary based on the completed build of the design proposal. One of the main criticisms that arose from the proposal was the lack of critical discussion in application to our customer, XYZ Retail. Upon writing the Executive Summary I aimed to amend this and explain thoroughly why we made certain design choices. As I was designing the model in MySQL it became apparent that there were some minor issues with the database design.</p>
							<p>Throughout the module I feel the most significant issue I faced was time management. At the start, trying to balance two modules with a full-time job and other commitments was extremely difficult, causing me to fall behind on some of the formative and E-portfolio tasks. Whilst I managed to start catching-up towards the end, I was unable to complete every required task. This is a shame as I found the content intuitive to learn. This is also not the first time lack of time management has held me back, however usually I have been able to counter this through strong adaptability and problem-solving skills. Whilst this resourcefulness is an essential trait to encourage progress and is highly valued by employers (Taylor et al, 1994), it can be tempting to rely on this too much and may feed into my problems with time management. As such, I should be careful to avoid becoming dependent on this.</p>
							<p>I found the data normalisation and build task particularly engaging as it allowed me to put into practice SQL skills that I have been training on. There were points where I was unsure on the best approach to take, but in the end I was able to build a successful relational database that met the third normal form. I learnt a lot through the trial and error of this process and will be able to take the skills I’ve learnt into my workplace. My employers store their data on SQL Server, so now that I understand the structure of it, I am able to identify and troubleshoot issues better.</p>
							<p>By contrast, a task I found challenging was the Collaborative Discussion on the differences between EU GDPR and the UK’s data protection rules. This is because they were so similar I struggled to identify any differences that would make a notable difference to data processors. It also made responding to peers difficult as most people approached it from the same viewpoint. I managed to overcome this writing block by rephrasing the question and asking whether there was any incentive for these to diverge.</p>
							<p>As a whole I am satisfied with my performance in this course, but there is definitely room for improvement. Planning and time management, in particular, have again meant my work has not met it’s full potential. Going forward, I think I need to be better at breaking projects down into a number of smaller tasks, as suggested by Hoover (2007). This should give me incremental goals to work towards and will allow me to better prioritise each stage of a project. Nevertheless, I am very pleased with the amount I have learnt and displayed throughout this module. I feel I am well placed to apply the database design skills learnt to the workplace and I feel that my knowledge of SQL has benefited as a result. In many instances it has already helped me in my role when importing from a SQL database.</p>
