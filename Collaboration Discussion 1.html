							<p>As more and more devices are connected to the internet and generate data, there are a number of clear benefits of the Internet of Things (IOT). There has been a fundamental shift in how data analysis is conducted with greater insight into processes on both a small and grand scale. This allows businesses and individuals to identify inefficiencies and change their behaviour to resolve them. A good example of this is energy smart meters, which allow individuals and the energy company to monitor usage and adjust the amount they use at specific times or respond to sudden demand.</p>
              <p>However, this growth in the IOT has a number of notable drawbacks. For example, it may lead to bottlenecks where either the network cannot transmit fast enough or the data cannot be processed fast enough by the users (Tejada, N.D.).</p>
              <p>Given the quantity of data and variety of sources, it is becoming more important to be able to cleanse this data effectively. Specialised tools such as Python and R are becoming essential to quickly check data quality and cleanse it if necessary (Sarkar and Roychowdhury, 2019). Ideally, the network should be designed to minimise errors in the data, such as spelling errors (Chapman, 2005). However, Huxley (2020) contends that this is harder to achieve and so there will always be a role for data cleansing.</p>
              <p>More importantly, security and privacy is a growing concern. These devices are often simple devices and cannot be secured in conventional ways, leaving systems vulnerable to attacks (Showail, 2021). System developers need to make sure that the network is encrypted whilst in transit, that devices are secure, and that they are able to authenticate and identify trusted devices.</p>
              <p>Overall, the Internet of Things offers huge potential benefits to users, but any network must be built with their processing ability, data quality, and security in mind. Without these, the benefits may be eliminated by the cost of correcting these mistakes.</p>
